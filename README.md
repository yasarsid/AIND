This is Personal Repo for Artificial Intelligence Nano Degree

Each Folder corresponds to a problem being solved.
 
 The First Problem attempted was

## 1- Soduku Solving Agent
The goal was to code a game playing agent that can solve a diagonal sudoku. Used various techniques to Solve them like eleminate, only choice, DFS, Naked Twin Elemination etc.
 

## 2 - Game Playing Agent to Play Isolation

In this project, students will develop an adversarial search agent to play the game "Isolation".  Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board.  Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game.  The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner.  


## 3 - Simulated Annealing demostration on the Travelling Salesman problem

This was part of the optional lab project and is avaiable on a jupyter notebook

## 4 - Planning - Air Cargo movement
Using various search and heuristics to determine the best way to move cargo between airports
